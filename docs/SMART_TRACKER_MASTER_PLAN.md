## Future Evolution: Personal Smart CoC Assistant (Phases 8-17)

**Vision Statement:** Transform the current web-based tracker into a personal, adaptive desktop assistant with multi-objective planning, passive state awareness, live recommendations, multi-village support, and automated ingestion via screenshot/OCR. This evolution shifts from "static optimizer" to "intelligent companion" that adapts to real-world usage patterns.

**Platform Shift:** Desktop app (Electron or native Windows) + local Windows automation service for background monitoring and OCR ingestion.

**Product Type:** Personal assistant (not public-first) - optimized for single-user, multi-village, always-on scenarios.

**Smart Behavior:** All heuristics + predictions + automation + adaptive rescheduling.

### Phase 8 - Multi-Objective Optimization Engine (COMPLETED)

**Status: ✅ Complete** (March 2026)

Implemented weighted objective functions with 5 profiles (TimeMax, Balanced, HeroAvailability, ResourceSmoothing, RushMode) using greedy list-scheduling approach. All acceptance criteria met and validated.

**Note**: Phase 8 was a successful stepping stone that proved the value of multi-objective optimization. However, it revealed fundamental greedy algorithm limitations (no backtracking, suboptimal makespan, resource bunching). This led to Phase 8b.

---

### Phase 8A - Electron Desktop App Conversion

**Status: 🔄 In Progress** (March 2026)

Convert React web app to Electron desktop application to enable Python subprocess execution for Google OR-Tools CP-SAT solver (Phase 8b).

**Why this matters**:
- Google OR-Tools only officially supports Python, Java, C++, and C#
- No official JavaScript/npm binding for CP-SAT solver
- Electron allows spawning Python subprocess from Node.js main process
- Unblocks CP-SAT implementation in Phase 8b
- Enables future desktop features (Phases 9-17): multi-village, OCR ingestion, background monitoring

#### Architecture

```
Electron App
├── Main Process (Node.js)  → spawns Python solver via child_process
├── Preload Script (IPC bridge)
└── Renderer Process (React) → IPC calls to main process

External: Python Subprocess
└── solvers/cpsat-scheduler.py (reads stdin, writes stdout JSON)
```

#### Tasks

**See `/docs/PHASE_8A_ELECTRON_CONVERSION_PLAN.md` for detailed 9-task breakdown:**

1. **Project Structure Refactoring** (1.5h) - Create Electron entry point, preload script, IPC wrapper
2. **Install Electron & Dependencies** (0.5h) - Add electron, electron-builder, dev helpers
3. **Create Electron Main Process** (1.5h) - Window management, basic IPC handlers, Python subprocess wrapper
4. **Create Preload & IPC Safety Layer** (1h) - Secure API bridge between React and main process
5. **Update Package.json Scripts** (0.5h) - dev, build, dist scripts for Electron
6. **Update React App Entry Point** (1h) - Detect Electron environment, adapt persistence layer
7. **Create Python Solver Stub** (1h) - Placeholder /solvers/cpsat-scheduler.py (full impl in Phase 8b)
8. **Testing & Validation** (2h) - Manual testing, build testing, fallback to web mode
9. **Documentation & Master Plan Update** (1h) - Electron architecture guide, Phase 8A checklist

#### Success Criteria

- [ ] `npm run dev` launches Electron window with React app running
- [ ] Village data persists via IPC (can load/save)
- [ ] Python subprocess call succeeds (JSON in → JSON out)
- [ ] All existing tests pass (backward compatible)
- [ ] Packaged app (.exe) runs standalone (no npm needed)
- [ ] Web fallback via localStorage still works
- [ ] Phase 8b can proceed (Python subprocess pipeline ready)

#### Timeline Estimate

**Total: 12-14 hours** (~1.5-2 days focused work)

**Detailed breakdown**:
- Task 1: 1.5h
- Task 2: 0.5h
- Task 3: 1.5h
- Task 4: 1.0h
- Task 5: 0.5h
- Task 6: 1.0h
- Task 7: 1.0h
- Task 8: 2.0h
- Task 9: 1.0h

### Phase 8b - Constraint Programming Scheduler (CP-SAT) Refactor

#### Objectives

Replace greedy list-scheduling algorithm with Constraint Programming (CP-SAT) solver from Google OR-Tools. This enables provably optimal scheduling while maintaining all Phase 8 functionality plus automatic "Just-In-Time Town Hall Trigger."

**Why this matters**:
- Greedy algorithm can't look ahead; often makes suboptimal task assignments
- CP-SAT explores millions of valid schedules to find the optimal one
- Automatically determines when to schedule Town Hall upgrade (no manual intervention)
- Resource smoothing works without hardcoded farming rates
- Provably minimizes builder idle time while respecting all constraints

#### Tasks

**Task 1: OR-Tools WASM Integration**
- Install google-ortools npm package (WASM build)
- Create src/solvers/cpsat-scheduler-base.js with CP model setup
- Verify solver can solve trivial scheduling problem (2 tasks, 1 builder)

**Task 2: Task Graph to CP Variables**
- Implement task-to-interval conversion in src/models/task-graph.js
- For each task: create interval variable (start, duration, end)
- For each task: create worker assignment variable (0, 1, or 2)
- Handle derived values (end = start + duration)

**Task 3: Hard Constraints (Precedence, Capacity, Sleep)**
- **Precedence**: For each predecessor, add constraint: start[i] >= end[predecessor]
- **Worker Capacity**: Add cumulative constraint (max 3 concurrent tasks)
- **Sleep Window**: For each task, add constraint: start time not in [23:00, 07:00]
- Test each constraint independently

**Task 4: Soft Penalties (Resource Smoothing, Idle Time, Weighted Completion)**
- **Weighted Completion Time**: Σ(weight[i] × end[i]) with priority tiers (Tier 1-6)
- **Daily Resource Smoothness**: Minimize (max_daily_cost - avg_daily_cost) per resource
- **Builder Idle Time**: Track free builder-hours and minimize
- Combine as weighted objective: W_time × completion + W_idle × idle + W_resource × smoothness

**Task 5: Solution Extraction & Validation**
- Extract solver solution to schedule array
- Implement src/solvers/cpsat-validator.js
- Validate all hard constraints post-solve (same as Task 3)
- Calculate actual objective value and compare to solver-reported

**Task 6: Unit Tests for CP Logic**
- Test: Precedence constraints respected
- Test: Worker capacity never exceeded
- Test: No tasks start during sleep
- Test: Resource smoothing penalty correct
- Test: Idle time calculation correct
- Test: Weighted completion respects priority tiers
- Test: Solver finds provably optimal solution on small instances

**Task 7: UI Integration & Backward Compatibility**
- Replace generateSchedule() to call CP-SAT solver instead of myScheduler()
- Update App.js to use new solver transparently
- Run existing scheduler.test.js tests (should pass with new solver)
- Add new tests comparing CP-SAT output to greedy on benchmarks

**Task 8: Performance Tuning & Validation**
- Benchmark solve times on test villages (TH6-TH15)
- Goal: < 5 seconds for typical village
- Verify JIT TH trigger: TH scheduled automatically when builders idle
- Verify resource smoothing: daily costs balanced
- Compare makespan quality: CP-SAT should be ≥ greedy on all test cases
- Document any solver limitations or edge cases found

#### Key Algorithm Details (See PHASE_8B_CP_SAT_SCHEDULER_SPECIFICATION.md)

**Hard Constraints**:
1. Precedence: Task $i$ starts after all predecessors complete
2. Worker Capacity: At most 3 builders active at any time
3. Sleep Window: No task can START between 23:00-07:00

**Soft Penalties** (weighted sum in objective):
1. **Weighted Completion Time**: $\sum_i \text{weight}_i \cdot \text{end}_i$ (respects 6-tier priority system)
2. **Daily Resource Smoothness**: Minimize variance of gold/elixir/dark-elixir costs across days
3. **Builder Idle Time**: Minimize free builder-hours

**Objective Function**:
$$\text{Minimize} = 1.0 \times \text{CompletionTime} + 0.001 \times \text{IdleTime} + 0.001 \times \text{ResourceSmoothing}$$

**Just-In-Time TH Trigger**:
- User provides buildings for current TH level + first batch of next TH level
- TH upgrade has weight = 50 (Tier 4, below offense/heavy defense, above heroes)
- As solver optimizes, it naturally schedules TH exactly when builders run out of parallel work
- Upon TH completion, next-level tasks unlock immediately, feeding idle builders
- Result: Automatic, provably optimal TH transition with no manual input

#### Success Criteria

- [ ] CP-SAT solver installed and builds successfully
- [ ] All hard constraints enforced (precedence, capacity, sleep)
- [ ] All soft penalties calculated correctly (completion time, resource smoothing, idle time)
- [ ] Validation tests pass (constraints verified post-solve)
- [ ] Regression tests pass (CP-SAT output ≥ greedy quality on benchmarks)
- [ ] JIT TH trigger verified on 3+ realistic test villages
- [ ] Resource smoothing verified (expensive upgrades spaced across days)
- [ ] Sleep window respected (no tasks start during 23:00-07:00)
- [ ] Performance acceptable (solve < 5s on typical village)
- [ ] UI generates schedules via CP-SAT (all generateSchedule calls routed through solver)
- [ ] Existing tests pass (backward compatibility maintained)
- [ ] Documentation complete (specification + code comments)

#### Timeline Estimate

- Task 1: 30 minutes
- Task 2: 2 hours
- Task 3: 1.5 hours
- Task 4: 2 hours
- Task 5: 1 hour
- Task 6: 1.5 hours
- Task 7: 1 hour
- Task 8: 1.5 hours

**Total: 11-12 hours** (1.5 days focused work)

**Smart Recommendations:**
- Factor in current resource levels (prefer tasks that drain excess resources)
- Avoid hero overlaps if war detected (from companion service or manual flag)
- Recompute queue when user marks task as started/completed
- Persist queue state across app restarts

#### Acceptance Criteria

#### Acceptance Criteria

- Rush mode prioritizes critical buildings over non-critical
- Progress tracker shows completion toward rush goal
- Schedule auto-transitions to balanced mode when goal reached
- Templates exist for TH8→15 transitions
- User can create custom rush configurations

---

### Phase 14 - Ingestion Reconciliation Layer

#### Objectives

Merge OCR-detected state with planned schedule and flag conflicts (started unplanned task, cancelled upgrade, timer mismatch). Provide truth reconciliation between plan and reality.

#### Tasks

**Conflict Detection:**
- Compare OCR state to planned tasks at same timestamp
- Flag discrepancies:
  - Unplanned task started (user improvised)
  - Planned task not started (user delayed)
  - Timer mismatch (OCR says 3d 2h, plan says 3d 5h)
  - Cancelled upgrade (was in progress, now not detected)

**Reconciliation UI:**
- Show conflicts in App.js dashboard ("3 unplanned tasks detected")
- Per-conflict actions: "Accept OCR state", "Keep plan", "Mark as error"
- Bulk accept: "Sync all to OCR state" (trust reality over plan)
- Review history: log of all reconciliation decisions

**State Merge Logic:**
- When OCR confident (>95% confidence): auto-accept and update plan
- When OCR low confidence: flag for user review
- When in-progress task detected: lock in as constraint for recompute
- When done task detected: add to done-state automatically

**Learning Mode:**
- Track OCR accuracy over time per building/hero type
- Adjust confidence thresholds based on historical accuracy
- Flag buildings that consistently trigger conflicts (user's custom play style)

#### Acceptance Criteria

- Conflicts detected and displayed with clear descriptions
- User can accept/reject OCR state per conflict
- High-confidence OCR updates auto-merge without prompts
- Reconciliation history viewable for audit
- Plan updates to match reality after conflict resolution

---

#### Tasks

**Recommendation Reasons:**
- Show "why this task now" in next-action queue
- Tooltip on timeline items: "Critical path for rush to TH11", "Minimizes hero downtime", "Uses excess gold"
- Color-code by recommendation strength (green: aligned with plan, yellow: acceptable, red: suboptimal)

**Hero-Lock Warnings:**
- Visual indicator when hero will be locked during configured war time
- "War conflict" badge on hero upgrade tasks
- Suggest alternative scheduling: "Delay 6 hours to avoid war window"

**Resource-Pressure Indicators:**
- Show when resources will cap ("Gold caps in 8 hours - start upgrade or waste 2.3M")
- Timeline heatmap: red zones = resource waste risk
- Smart trainer suggestions: "Dump 5M elixir into troop research before Lab closes"

**Historical Insights:**
- Average upgrade delay (user starts tasks 2.3 hours after plan on average)
- Builder utilization rate (80% active time, 20% idle)
- Most-delayed categories (user consistently delays defenses)
- Time-to-TH projection based on actual completion rate

**Mobile-Responsive Cards:**
- Swipe gestures for done/undo on mobile
- Collapsible category sections
- Quick-filter: "Show only next 24 hours"

#### Acceptance Criteria

- Recommendation reasons visible on hover and in queue
- Hero-lock warnings prevent war-time conflicts
- Resource-pressure indicators show waste risk accurately
- Historical insights display user's actual completion patterns
- Mobile UX supports touch gestures for common actions

## Comprehensive Verification Plan (Phases 8-17)

### Functional Verification

**Adaptive Rescheduling (Phase 11):**
- Simulate delayed builder starts (user doesn't start task on time)
- Verify automatic recompute updates "start next" suggestions without pressing generate
- Test drift threshold detection (2+ hour delay triggers auto-recompute)
- Validate in-progress tasks remain locked during recompute
- Confirm done-state preserved after adaptive reschedule

**Multi-Objective Optimization (Phase 8):**
- Generate schedules with each objective profile (Balanced, HeroAvailability, ResourceSmoothing, TimeMax, RushMode)
- Verify distinct task orderings for different profiles
- Test custom weight adjustments produce expected behavior
- Validate hero-lock constraints respected in HeroAvailability mode
- Confirm rush-critical buildings prioritized in RushMode

**Real-Time Assistant (Phase 10):**
- Start schedule, fast-forward to builder completion time
- Verify next-action queue updates automatically without manual action
- Test recommendation reasons display correctly
- Validate urgency indicators (green/yellow/red) based on resource waste risk
- Confirm queue persists across app restart

### Multi-Village Verification

**Village Switching:**
- Create 3 villages with different village data (TH levels, strategies, progress)
- Switch between villages rapidly (5+ switches in 30 seconds)
- Verify each switch loads correct village state (schedule, done-keys, settings)
- Confirm no cross-village contamination (Village A's done-state doesn't affect Village B)
- Test village deletion removes all associated data

**Independent Strategies:**
- Set Village 1 to LPT, Village 2 to SPT, Village 3 to RushMode
- Generate schedules for each village
- Switch between villages and verify strategy persists
- Modify Village 2 strategy to Balanced, switch away and back
- Confirm Village 2 now uses Balanced, others unchanged

**Performance at Scale:**
- Load 5+ villages (simulate heavy user with main + alts)
- Verify app startup time acceptable (<3 seconds)
- Test village switching remains responsive (<500ms)
- Monitor memory usage doesn't grow unbounded with more villages
- Validate localStorage size limits not exceeded (estimate <10MB total)

### OCR Pipeline Verification

**Screenshot Capture:**
- Open Clash of Clans on Windows
- Trigger companion service capture (manual or auto-interval)
- Verify screenshot saved to local folder with timestamp
- Test capture during various CoC screens (builder menu, village view)
- Confirm privacy: screenshots stored locally, not transmitted

**OCR Accuracy:**
- Collect 20 test screenshots with known builder states
- Run OCR parsing on each screenshot
- Calculate accuracy: correct detections / total builders
- Target: >90% accuracy for builder names, levels, timer text
- Identify failure patterns (small fonts, overlapping UI, partial builds)

**State Mapping:**
- OCR detects "Town Hall L14 - 10d 5h 23m"
- Verify mapped to correct task: {id: "Town_Hall", level: 14, remainingTime: 896580}
- Test fuzzy matching for variations ("TH14", "Town Hall 14", "Townhall lv14")
- Validate timer parsing for various formats (10d 5h, 23h 45m, 3m 12s)

**Conflict Detection:**
- Plan shows "Barracks L12" starting in 2 hours
- OCR detects "Barracks L11 - 3d 1h" (user started early or different task)
- Verify conflict flagged: "Unplanned task detected"
- Test reconciliation: user accepts OCR state, plan updates Barracks L12 start time
- Confirm next-action queue recalculates after reconciliation

### Quality and Integration Checks

**Build and Deploy:**
- Run `npm test -- --watchAll=false` for web app portion
- Verify all tests pass (target: 50+ tests for Phases 8-17)
- Run `npm run build` for Electron desktop app
- Verify build succeeds without warnings
- Test desktop installer on clean Windows 10/11 machine

**Companion Service:**
- Install companion service via installer
- Verify auto-starts on Windows login
- Check system tray icon shows "connected" status
- Test connection to main app (send mock OCR data, verify received)
- Confirm graceful degradation if CoC not running (service idle, no errors)

**End-to-End User Journey:**
1. Install desktop app + companion service
2. Import village JSON (TH12 with 30 pending upgrades)
3. Set objective profile to RushMode (target: TH13)
4. Generate schedule, verify critical buildings prioritized
5. Open CoC, start an upgrade from plan
6. Companion service captures state via OCR
7. App detects started task, locks it in schedule
8. Mark 2 more tasks complete manually in app
9. Simulate 6 hour time jump (adjust system clock or mock timers)
10. Verify adaptive reschedule triggers automatically
11. Check next-action queue shows new recommendations
12. Export all data, wipe app, import backup, verify restoration
13. Add second village, switch between them, confirm independence

**Performance Benchmarks:**
- Schedule generation for 100-task village: <2 seconds (any objective profile)
- Village switching: <500ms
- Next-action queue update: <200ms

## Product Vision Alignment

**Current Product (Phases 0-7):**  
Static optimizer with manual input and tracking

**Evolved Product (Phases 8-17):**  
Personal adaptive assistant with passive awareness and live guidance

**Key Shift:**  
From "user initiates all actions" to "app suggests actions based on real-time state"

**Value Proposition:**  
"Your CoC advisor that tells you exactly what to start when a builder finishes, adapts to your actual play patterns, and keeps all your villages on optimal upgrade paths without manual planning."

---

## Cross-Cutting Technical Decisions

- Maintain existing public API of schedule generation where possible.
- Prefer additive refactors over breaking rewrites.
- Keep data source files as JSON under source control.
- Keep local-only app model and avoid backend assumptions.
- Use deterministic sorting tie-breakers everywhere relevant.
- Keep duration units in seconds across scheduler core.
- Keep conversion to display strings at view boundaries.
- Centralize task key generation and reuse across components.
- Keep strategy options limited to LPT/SPT in current cycle.
- Maintain explicit base mode branching with shared helper utilities.

## Dependency Map

- Phase 1 depends on Phase 0 baseline fixtures.
- Phase 2 can start with Phase 0 outputs but must align with Phase 1 API updates.
- Phase 3 depends on Phase 1 and Phase 2 stable data contracts.
- Phase 4 depends on Phase 3 interaction model and existing key patterns.
- Phase 5 can run in parallel after Phase 1 correctness locks.
- Phase 6 begins early but completes after Phases 1-5.
- Phase 7 requires successful quality gates from Phase 6.
- Data linting supports Phases 1 and 2.
- Persistence migration must be complete before final release.
- Documentation updates are continuous, finalized in Phase 7.

## Risks and Mitigations

### Risk Register

- Risk: Scheduler behavior changes unintentionally during refactor.
- Mitigation: Baseline fixtures plus deterministic regression tests.
